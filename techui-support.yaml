# This file is used to define what support module screens can be found in this repo. It is used by
# techui-builder to automatically generate screens. The auto-generated screens are built by defining
# what IOC they should be built for. The ibek configuration for this ioc in the k8s services repo
# eg i19-services/services/bl19i-di-cam-02/config/ioc.yaml is then consulted to find what support
# modules the IOC uses. techui-builder then finds the screens for these support modules which are
# either located here or in another ui-support repo. This file is used by techui-builder as way of
# knowing what screens are in this repo and what configuration they require.
#
# Example config:
#
# ADAravis.aravisCamera:                          # Ibek identification string for support module
#   - file: "ADAravis/ADAravis_summary.bob"       # Path to bob file
#     prefix: "$(P)$(R)"                          # Prefixes required from Ibek configuration
#     type: "embedded"
#   - file: "ADAravis/ADAravis_detail.bob"
#     prefix: "$(P)$(R)"
#     type: "related"
